## About me
I'm working in interior design/construction industry and right now I'm exploring career-switch opportunities. I used to make websites for my friends using CMS like Joomla and Wordpress but I've never taken a deep dive into underlying web-technologies. This time I'm looking forward to refresh and expand my knowledge about web-development.
